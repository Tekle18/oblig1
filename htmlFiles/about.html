    <h1 style="text-decoration: underline;">Project report</h1>
    At the start of the project we discussed how the project is going to be structured and the layout of the pages. 
    At the end of this meeting we created a rough guiding line for the project structure and page layout.
     One of the important decisions were that we were going to use a css file for each html file that we have.
      This was dicided so that we can have clearer code and better project structure. We also decided to use a made up persona for the project. 
       The guidelines for the page layout we made at the start include to use as many photos as possible and 
       to try to align these with some texts like description and list to hold hobbies. At the end we can say that we followed our guidlines and
       ended up making a web site that works and shows the persons ability and achivments. This is offcourse besides the minor issues that we faced which will be discussed 
       on each pages report.

                <p id="homepage">
                    <h2 style="text-decoration: underline;">Homepage</h2>
                    The home page is designed using two images. This images were styled using the tag &lt;div&gt;. 
                    The reason we chose to do it this way is mainly to align the different elements we used
                     on the same line. We managed to create the navigation bar which is carrying the links to 
                     the different pages of site. These works like they suppose to and the are made using the &lt;ul&gt; and &lt;il&gt; tags.
                     The page might be exepirienced as empty but we struggled to have lists underneath. The reason waas when we try to make 
                     other lists that can contain hobbies for example, they we ruined by the list we defined above for the
                     links of the pages.     </p>


                    <p id="resume">
                        <h2 style="text-decoration: underline;">Resume</h2>
                        on the resume page we have used an image under the links. we have styled the image position to relativ, inorder to allign it to the porsition
        we want. we think adding an image to the page improves the appearance. Further we have used
        heading for the main topics and we have styled it with a background color. This makes easier to distinguish it from the subtopics 
        and gives the reader a beter overview. we have used unordered list for the sub topics and displayed it block.
                    </p>

                     <p id="portofolio">
                         <h2 style="text-decoration: underline;">Portofolio</h2>
                         The portofolio page is designed so that it shows the acoplishments of the person nurse. Thus we chose to do that by having many &lt;div&gt; tags
                         that includes an image and a &lt;div&gt; tag for the discription. The images are clickecle and are ment to open 
                         in a new window. But this is not working for some reason we are not able to fix at the momemnt. Links to the other pages are included on this page, therefor
                         is is possible to navigate to the other pages from this page. 
                     </p>

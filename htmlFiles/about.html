                    <h2 style="text-decoration: underline;">Homepage</h2>
                    The home page is designed using two images. This images were styled using the tag &lt;div&gt;. 
                    The reason we chose to do it this way is mainly to align the different elements we used
                     on the same line. We managed to create the navigation bar which is carrying the links to 
                     the different pages of site. These works like they suppose to and the are made using the &lt;ul&gt; and &lt;il&gt; tags.
                     The page might be exepirienced as empty but we struggled to have lists underneath. The reason waas when we try to make 
                     other lists that can contain hobbies for example, they we ruined by the list we defined above for the
                     links of the pages.     </p>


                     <p id="portofolio">
                         <h2 style="text-decoration: underline;">Portofolio</h2>
                         The portofolio page is designed so that it shows the acoplishments of the person nurse. Thus we chose to do that by having many &lt;div&gt; tags
                         that includes an image and a &lt;div&gt; tag for the discription. The images are clickecle and are ment to open 
                         in a new window. But this is not working for some reason we are not able to fix at the momemnt. Links to the other pages are included on this page, therefor
                         is is possible to navigate to the other pages from this page.
